# TestCreateGame
In the KeeperTestSuite of the TicTacToe module, the TestCreateGame function tests the functionality of creating a new game.

Here's a brief description of the tests conducted:

Valid Game Creation: Ensures that a game can be created successfully with valid parameters such as a valid admin address.

Invalid Admin Address: this checks for proper handling when an invalid admin address is provided during game creation.

Each test case constructs different scenarios and verifies the behavior of the CreateGame function under those conditions.
